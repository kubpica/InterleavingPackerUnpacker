Created for editing game files of Turok2 (1998 one) but it can be used for other purposes.

This program finds a hierarchy/structures in .lsm and .lss files and extracts them to files with unknown extension but I am not sure if the decryption of the Turok2 files is done correctly. I don't know much about reverse engineering so we only managed to swap the textures and models among themselves, it can result in fun effects :D
